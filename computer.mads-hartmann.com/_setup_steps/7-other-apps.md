There's few tools I usually always use:

```sh
# common gnu utilities. Almost certainly needed for bash scripts that run on Linux (CI).
brew install coreutils
```

And some other ones:

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com). I use this as an app launcher, dictionary, clipboard manager.
- [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com)
- [BetterSnapTool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580)
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com)
