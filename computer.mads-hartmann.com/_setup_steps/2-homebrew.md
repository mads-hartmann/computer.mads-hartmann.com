Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) so we can install all the other thigns we'll need:

```
/usr/bin/ruby \
    -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

[iTerm](https://iterm2.com) is my terminal of choice:

```
brew cask install iterm2
brew install zsh-completions
```

Install a few things from the app store
