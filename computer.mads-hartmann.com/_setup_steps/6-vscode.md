title: Visual Studio Code
---

Sorry Emacs, I've converted:

```
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

I have a few extensions that I definitely need:

```
code --install-extension \
  EditorConfig.EditorConfig \
  letrieu.expand-region \
  eamodio.gitlens
```

The rest of the configuration lives in my dotfiles, so they should already be in place.
