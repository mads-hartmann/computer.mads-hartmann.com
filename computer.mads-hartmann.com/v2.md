title: ~ v2

This is v2. The major change from [v1](/v1) is that I now do 99% of my development in [Cloud Development Environments (CDE)](https://www.gitpod.io/cde) which means that I install _very_ few tools locally.

## Decisions and tl;dr

- I automate as little of the initial setup as possible (installing apps etc.). Spending time automating something that it's quite unlikely I'll ever run again on the same OS, the same hardware, or even the same desired end goal, just wasn't worth the effort for me. Instead I maintain a little setup guide for the few occasions where I actually have to set up a new mac from scratch (see below).

- I use ZSH as my shell (that's the default since macOS Catalina). I use Spaceship as my prompt configuration.

- I use the default Terminal rather than [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) as I do very little in my local terminal these days.

- I use 1Password

- I use Tailscale to connect to

- I manage global system dependencies using Nix. I don't use [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

## Setting up a new mac

### Installing GUI apps

- [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) A lovely tool which helps you control your apps and OS. Replaced my usage of Alfred and BetterSnapTool.
- [1Password](https://1password.com) for all my personal credentials. Install it using the App Store.

### Setting up Nix

To install Nix I do need some basic development tools installed like `git`, `curl` and so on:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

TODO: Actually install nix

Create ` ~/.config/nix/nix.conf` with the following contents

```
extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

Add the channels I'll be using

```
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-22.11 nixos
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos-unstable
nix-channel --update
```

### Shell

Don't show the `Last login` message for every new terminal session:

```sh
touch ~/.hushlogin
```

Create a basic profile for ZSH and enable tab completions

```sh
touch ~/.zprofile
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit'  >> ~/.zprofile
```

Add an alias for `tailscale`

```sh
echo 'alias tailscale="/Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale"' >> ~/.zprofile
```

Install [starship](http://starship.rs) and use it for ZSH

```sh
nix profile install nixpkgs#starship
starship init zsh >> ~/.zprofile
```

Add some basic [configuration](https://starship.rs/config) for Starship

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config && touch ~/.config/starship.toml
echo 'add_newline = false' >> ~/.config/starship.toml
```

### SSH

I use 1Password to manage my SSH keys ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh)) and rely on their SSH agent ([docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent)). For the agent to work the following is placed in `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *
  IdentityAgent "~/Library/Group Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock"
```

To verify it works run the following

```sh
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/Library/Group\ Containers/2BUA8C4S2C.com.1password/t/agent.sock
ssh-add -l
```

### devenv

I use [devenv](https://devenv.sh/)

```sh
nix profile install github:cachix/devenv/v0.4
```
