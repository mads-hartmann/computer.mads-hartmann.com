I've tried a lot of different approaches to managing my dotfiles over the years. They varied in scope and complexity, but they all eded up being too much work to maintain. So this is my final iteration[^1].

Now I use a [bare git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---bare) repository - [mads-hartmann/dotfilesv2](https://github.com/mads-hartmann/dotfilesv2) - in my `$HOME` folder for the actual dotfiles and maintain [a little setup guide](/setting-up-a-new-mac) for the few occasions where I actually have to set up a new mac from scratch.

[^1]: Please let this be the final version.
