TODO:
- Finish remote example in nix/demo/remote
- Document my "convention" around "packages" for my fragments
- Might be fun to hook into to shell so it says what binaries are available in the shell and what "fragment" contributed it

- move site to "www"
- Fix gitpod setup so this repo actually uses nix too :P
