TODO:
- Finish remote example in nix/demo/remote
- Document my "convention" around "packages" for my fragments
- Might be fun to hook into to shell so it says what binaries are available in the shell and what "fragment" contributed it
- TODO: Show how to create "one-off" shells from fragments, something like `nix develop github:mads-hartmann/computer.mads-hartmann.com/nix?dir=nix/fragments/kubernetes`

- move site to "www"
- Fix gitpod setup so this repo actually uses nix too :P
